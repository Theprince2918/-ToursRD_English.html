📖 Our Travel Philosophy

We are not a luxury resort with climate-controlled pools, umbrella drinks and air conditioning all day.

Our mission is to show you the Dominican countryside as it really is: connecting with local people, hearing the "bullá" (friendly commotion) of the community, the sounds of animals, and the authentic rhythm of countryside life.

✨ If you seek luxury and absolute perfection, there are five-star resorts for you.
🌿 But if you're interested in knowing us, learning a bit more about this beautiful country, living like Dominicans do and taking memories for a lifetime... you've come to the right place!

We are authentic experience. We are real Dominican Republic. 🇩🇴

📜 Our History and Social Commitment

🇩🇴 San José de los Llanos: Agricultural Town and Rural Heart

San José de los Llanos is the authentic rural heart of the Dominican Republic. Located in San Pedro de Macorís province, just 60-70 minutes from Las Américas Airport, this peaceful municipality is known for its vast farmlands, genuine countryside life and warm people who maintain Dominican traditions.

This is a town where time still moves slowly, where work on the land defines daily life, and where community solidarity is more valuable than anything else. The colorful houses, public squares and historic churches speak to the deep identity of our people.

At Finca La Gata, we honor that living history by sharing with our visitors the true Dominican culture: rural resilience, genuine hospitality, Creole recipes and pride in our roots. Here you'll learn how we Dominicans really live.

Welcome to Finca La Gata.

My name is José Pérez and I am the owner of this farm. I want you to know that I will be here with my family and our staff throughout your stay. It's not a resort where you'll receive a registration number. Here you are part of our family.

When you arrive at Finca La Gata, you will be the only group here (besides my family and our staff). This is intimacy, privacy and personalized attention. You'll meet the people who really live here, hear the "bullá" (joyful noise) of our countryside, the sounds of animals, and the real rhythm of Dominican rural life.

Please remember: Don't blame a country for a bad experience you had with one or two people. The Dominican Republic is beautiful. Our people are hardworking, warm and authentic. If you come with an open heart, respect and willingness to learn, you'll take home memories that will change your life.

Here on the farm, we treat each other like brothers and sisters.
Come to enjoy, learn and experience a piece of this beautiful country.
